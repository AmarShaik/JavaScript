# 10 Days of JavaScript – HackerRank Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the **"10 Days of JavaScript"** challenge on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). The challenge is designed to help developers strengthen their understanding of JavaScript through a series of progressively structured problems.

---

## Overview

- A collection of `.js` files that solve each problem presented during the 10-day challenge.
- Each file demonstrates a specific concept such as functions, loops, arrays, regular expressions, or error handling.
- The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey and provide a reference for others practicing the same problems.

## Challenge Objectives

Each day introduces different core concepts of JavaScript. Topics covered include:

- Day 0: Data types, variable declarations, and simple input/output
- Day 1: Arithmetic operations, functions, and conditional logic
- Day 2: Loops and regular expressions
- Day 3: Arrays and string manipulation
- Day 4: Objects and JSON
- Day 5: Classes and object-oriented programming
- Day 6: Inheritance and prototype chain
- Day 7: Error handling using `try`, `catch`, and `throw`
- Day 8: Advanced array methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`
- Day 9: DOM manipulation (Binary Calculator)

---

## File Structure

Each file in the repository is named to reflect the problem or concept it addresses. For example:

- `arithmeticops.js` – Basic arithmetic operations
- `arrowfunc.js` – Arrow functions usage
- `regexps.js` – Regular expression patterns
- `factorial.js` – Recursive function implementation
- `throw.js` – Error handling with `throw`
- `classes.js` – Class-based structure in JavaScript
- `day9_binary_calculator/` – Project for DOM-based binary calculator

---

## Skills Practiced

This challenge helps reinforce the following concepts:

- Variable scope and declarations (`let`, `const`, `var`)
- Data types and type coercion
- Function declarations and arrow functions
- Loops (`for`, `while`) and control flow
- Arrays, array methods, and manipulation
- String processing
- Object manipulation and class-based design
- Regular expressions
- Exception handling
- DOM manipulation and event-driven programming
